# Active Context - Current Session

## Current Date: 2025-07-15

## Session Summary
- **MAJOR COMPLETION**: Successfully implemented complete Fan User Type Integration
- Fixed fan authentication and access control issues
- Fan registration, payment, dashboard, and concert discovery all working
- Server running successfully on localhost:3000 with all user types functional

## What I Just Completed
- **Task**: Fan User Type Integration - **FULLY COMPLETED** ✅
- **Status**: All fan features implemented and tested successfully
- **Key Fix**: Fan `paymentStatus` properly passed through authentication callbacks

## Major Accomplishments This Session
1. **Fan Registration Flow** ✅ - Complete with payment integration
2. **Fan Authentication** ✅ - Fixed session data to include paymentStatus
3. **Fan Dashboard** ✅ - Role-specific dashboard with concert reservations
4. **Fan Concert Discovery** ✅ - Artists page shows concerts for fans
5. **Fan Navigation** ✅ - Header navigation updated for fan user type
6. **Fan Access Control** ✅ - Payment-based access instead of approval-based

## Next Priority Tasks (from roadmap)
1. **Backend Integration Foundation** (NEW Priority)
   - [ ] Set up database schema design
   - [ ] Create API infrastructure for real data
   - [ ] Replace mock data with backend integration

2. **Enhanced Search Reimplementation**
   - [ ] Carefully rebuild advanced filtering without server issues
   - [ ] Test thoroughly to avoid previous problems

## Key Decisions Made This Session
- Completed fan user type as third user category (alongside artists/hosts)
- Fans use payment status for access control vs approval status for artists/hosts
- Fan registration bypasses approval process with immediate payment access
- Concert discovery integrated into existing artists page with conditional rendering

## Important Context
- All three user types now fully functional (Artist, Host, Fan)
- Fan demo account working: jessica.fan@email.com / fan123
- Form validation with Zod updated to support fan registration
- Design system supports all user types with appropriate messaging
