# Active Context - Current Session

## Current Date: 2025-07-13

## Session Summary
- Restored working code from git stash (commit 971aca3)
- Fixed server issues that arose from enhanced search implementation
- Reverted enhanced search components that caused problems
- Server now running successfully on localhost:3000

## What I'm Doing Right Now
- **Task**: Access Control UI Architecture implementation
- **Status**: Memory-bank setup complete, ready to start approval status pages
- **Next Immediate Step**: Design and implement approval status pages for different user states

## Next Priority Tasks (from roadmap)
1. **Access Control UI Architecture** (Current Priority)
   - [ ] Design approval status pages and notifications
   - [ ] Plan gated dashboard access based on approval + payment status
   - [ ] Implement conditional navigation based on user access level

2. **Split Artist Onboarding**
   - [ ] Create minimal application form (essential approval data only)
   - [ ] Design approval-pending status page
   - [ ] Create payment gateway integration for approved artists
   - [ ] Build complete profile creation (post-payment detailed data)

## Key Decisions Made This Session
- Reverted enhanced search functionality due to server issues
- Preserved form validation and design system updates
