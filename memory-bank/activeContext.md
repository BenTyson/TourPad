5. **Host Data Enhancement** âœ… - Added mapLocation data to all hosts in mockData
6. **Broken Image Fixes** âœ… - Replaced broken Unsplash URLs with working ones

## Current Priority: Interactive Map Implementation
1. **Map Foundation** ðŸ”¥ **ACTIVE**
   - [x] Enhanced host data with privacy-focused coordinates
   - [ ] Install Leaflet mapping library
   - [ ] Create core MapContainer component
   - [ ] Build HostMarker and HostPopup components
   - [ ] Implement MapFilters sidebar
   - [ ] Create /map page with mobile-first design

2. **Map Features**
   - [ ] Tour planning mode for multi-city routes
   - [ ] Integration with booking system
   - [ ] Mobile touch interactions and offline capability

## Key Decisions Made This Session
- **Map Architecture**: Leaflet + OpenStreetMap for free, customizable mapping
- **Privacy-First Approach**: Offset coordinates (Â±0.5-1km) to protect host locations  
- **Mobile-First Design**: Touch interactions, progressive loading, GPS integration
- **Artist-Centric UX**: Discovery mode for new artists, tour planning for experienced ones
- **Data Schema Enhancement**: Added mapLocation with search keywords to all hosts
- **Booking Page Streamlining**: Consolidated status display, removed redundant sections

## Important Context
- Map component will be central discovery system for TourPad
- Privacy protection: exact addresses only revealed after booking confirmation
- Tour planning mode enables multi-city route optimization for artists
- Mobile experience is primary (artists often on the road)
- Integration with existing booking system and host profiles

## Files Modified This Session
- `/src/data/mockData.ts` - Added mapLocation data to all hosts, fixed broken images
- `/src/app/bookings/[id]/page.tsx` - Fixed data lookup, added profile photos, streamlined UI  
- `/DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md` - Added Interactive Map Component as high priority
- `/memory-bank/activeContext.md` - Updated with map planning progress

## Commands to Remember
- Start server: `npm run dev`
- Current branch: main
