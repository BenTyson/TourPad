# TourPad Interactive Map Component - Architecture Documentation

## Overview
The TourPad Interactive Map is a privacy-focused, mobile-first venue discovery system designed as the central nervous system for the touring ecosystem. Artists can discover hosts, plan multi-city tours, and book venues through an intuitive Airbnb-style interface.

## Core Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Mapping Library**: Leaflet + OpenStreetMap (free, lightweight, highly customizable)
- **Frontend Integration**: React 19 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS v4
- **Data Source**: Enhanced mockData.ts with privacy-protected coordinates

### Component Structure
```
/src/app/map/page.tsx           # Main map page
/src/components/map/
  ├── MapContainer.tsx          # Core map logic with clustering
  ├── HostMarker.tsx           # Individual venue markers  
  ├── HostPopup.tsx            # Marker click popup
  ├── MapFilters.tsx           # Sidebar filters
  └── MapSearch.tsx            # City/location search
```

## Data Schema

### Enhanced Host Map Data
```typescript
interface HostMapData {
  // Core Identity
  id: string;
  name: string;
  
  // Privacy-Protected Location
  displayLat: number;        // Offset ±0.5-1km for privacy
  displayLng: number;
  city: string;
  state: string;
  priceRange: string;
  searchKeywords: string[];
  
  // Venue Details
  venueType: string;
  capacity: { min: number; max: number };
  rating: number;
  reviewCount: number;
  
  // Availability Context
  responseTime: string;
  recentActivity: boolean;
}
```

### Privacy Protection Strategy
- **Approximate Markers**: Display coordinates offset by 0.5-1km from real location
- **Graduated Disclosure**: Address revealed only after booking confirmation
- **Host Control**: Hosts can adjust privacy radius in settings
- **No Exact Addresses**: Map never shows precise street addresses

## User Experience Flows

### Primary User Journeys

1. **Discovery Mode** (New Artists):
   - Land on map centered on artist's location or major music cities
   - Zoom into cities to reveal host clusters
   - Click markers for host preview popup
   - Filter by "beginner-friendly" venues

2. **Tour Planning Mode** (Experienced Artists):
   - Multi-select venues across regions
   - Route optimization suggestions
   - Calendar integration for date planning
   - Export tour plan functionality

3. **Mobile Quick-Search** (Artists on the road):
   - GPS-based "Venues Near Me"
   - Emergency booking for tour gaps
   - Voice search capabilities

### Mobile-First Design Principles
- **Touch Interactions**: Large touch targets (minimum 44px)
- **Gesture Support**: Pinch-to-zoom, drag-to-pan, swipe gestures
- **Progressive Loading**: Load venues in viewport first
- **Offline Capability**: Cache key metropolitan areas
- **GPS Integration**: Auto-center on artist's location

## Integration Points

### With Existing TourPad Systems
- **Dashboard**: "Plan Tour" button launches map in tour mode
- **Calendar**: Map shows venues with conflicting dates grayed out
- **Messages**: Direct link to contact venues from map
- **Booking System**: Pre-populate booking forms with map selections
- **Host Profiles**: Deep links to full host profile pages

### Authentication Integration
- **Artist Profile Data**: Use for personalized recommendations
- **Booking History**: Show previously played venues
- **Preferences**: Remember filter settings across sessions

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1 - MVP (Core Discovery)
- [x] Enhanced mockData with privacy-protected coordinates
- [ ] Install Leaflet mapping library
- [ ] Basic map with venue markers
- [ ] Simple filtering by city and venue type
- [ ] Mobile-responsive design
- [ ] Integration with existing booking system

### Phase 2 - Enhanced Features
- [ ] Tour planning mode
- [ ] Advanced filtering (genre, availability, capacity)
- [ ] Venue clustering and route optimization
- [ ] Offline capability for major cities

### Phase 3 - Intelligence & Community (Future)
- [ ] AI-powered tour recommendations
- [ ] Social features (recent shows, artist reviews)
- [ ] Market analytics and insights
- [ ] Advanced privacy controls

## Technical Considerations

### Performance Optimizations
- **Venue Clustering**: Group nearby venues at lower zoom levels
- **Lazy Loading**: Load venue details on demand
- **Image Optimization**: Compress and cache venue photos
- **Map Tile Caching**: Cache tiles for major metropolitan areas

### Accessibility Features
- **Screen Reader Support**: Full ARIA labels for map interactions
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Tab through all map features
- **High Contrast Mode**: Enhanced visibility for map elements
- **Voice Commands**: "Find venues near Austin, Texas"

### Security & Privacy
- **Location Privacy**: Never expose exact addresses on map
- **Data Protection**: Secure handling of user location data
- **Safe Defaults**: Conservative privacy settings by default

## Success Metrics
