# TourPad Project Brief

TourPad is a Next.js-based platform that connects touring musicians with hosts for intimate house concerts and small shows, using a gated access model where artists must apply and pay $400/year for membership while hosts apply for free approval. The platform prioritizes privacy and community quality by keeping all artist/host data hidden from public view until users are approved, creating an exclusive marketplace for authentic house concert experiences.
