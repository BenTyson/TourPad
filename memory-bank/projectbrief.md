# TourPad Project Brief

TourPad is a Next.js-based platform that connects touring musicians with hosts for intimate house concerts and small shows, while also serving music fans who want to discover and attend these exclusive events. The platform uses a gated access model where artists and hosts must apply for approval (artists pay $400/year, hosts free), while fans can register and pay directly for immediate access to the community. The platform prioritizes privacy and community quality by keeping all user data hidden from public view until membership is secured, creating an exclusive marketplace for authentic house concert experiences.

## User Types & Access Model
- **Artists**: Apply → Approval → $400/year payment → Full community access  
- **Hosts**: Apply → Approval → Free access to post venues and book artists
- **Fans**: Register → Direct payment → Immediate access to discover and attend concerts
- **Admin**: Platform management with full access to all features
