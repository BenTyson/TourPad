# TourPad Booking Management System

## System Overview

The TourPad booking management system provides a complete workflow for artists to request bookings from hosts, hosts to respond and negotiate terms, and admins to monitor all platform activity. The system supports the full booking lifecycle from initial request to completion.

## ✅ Implementation Status: COMPLETE

All core booking management functionality has been implemented and is ready for testing when localhost stability is restored.

## Technical Implementation

### Core Components

#### 1. BookingCard Component (`/src/components/bookings/BookingCard.tsx`)

**Purpose**: Display individual booking requests with appropriate actions

**Features**:
- Role-based display (artist/host/admin perspectives)
- Status-specific action buttons
- Comprehensive booking information display
- Real-time status updates with optimistic UI
- Responsive design for all screen sizes

**Props**:
```typescript
interface BookingCardProps {
  booking: BookingData;
  viewType: 'artist' | 'host' | 'admin';
  onStatusUpdate?: (bookingId: string, status: string, data?: any) => Promise<void>;
  onViewDetails?: (bookingId: string) => void;
  className?: string;
}
```

#### 2. BookingList Component (`/src/components/bookings/BookingList.tsx`)

**Purpose**: Manage collections of bookings with filtering, sorting, and bulk operations

**Features**:
- Advanced search across multiple fields (artist, host, venue, messages)
- Multi-level filtering by status with live counts
- Sorting by date, status, creation time (ascending/descending)
- Real-time refresh capability
- Empty state handling
- Optimistic UI updates

**Props**:
```typescript
interface BookingListProps {
  viewType: 'artist' | host' | 'admin';
  onStatusUpdate?: (bookingId: string, status: string, data?: any) => Promise<void>;
  onRefresh?: () => Promise<void>;
  className?: string;
}
```

#### 3. Dashboard Pages

**Artist/Host Bookings Page** (`/src/app/dashboard/bookings/page.tsx`):
- Authentication checks and user type validation
- Admin redirection to admin dashboard
- Role-specific headers and navigation
- Integration with BookingList component
- Status update handling with API integration

**Admin Bookings Page** (`/src/app/admin/bookings/page.tsx`):
- Admin-only access control
- Platform-wide booking overview
- Quick statistics dashboard

### API Integration

#### Individual Booking Endpoint (`/api/bookings/[id]/route.ts`)

**Complete Implementation**: Full CRUD operations with Prisma integration

**Methods**:
- **GET**: Retrieve booking details with permission checks

**Example Usage**:
```typescript
// Update booking status with additional data
const response = await fetch(`/api/bookings/${bookingId}`, {
  method: 'PUT',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    status: 'APPROVED',
    hostResponse: 'Looking forward to having you perform!',
    artistFee: 150,
    doorFee: 10
  }),
});
```

#### Booking List Endpoint (`/api/bookings/route.ts`)

**Existing Implementation**: Basic booking retrieval with filtering

**Features**:
- User-specific booking queries based on role
- Status and date filtering capabilities
- Integration with frontend components

  createdAt          DateTime       @default(now())
  updatedAt          DateTime       @updatedAt
}
```

### BookingStatus Enum (Existing)

```prisma
enum BookingStatus {
  PENDING
  APPROVED
  REJECTED
  CONFIRMED
  COMPLETED
  CANCELLED
}
```
