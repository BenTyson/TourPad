## üöß CRITICAL NEXT PRIORITY (Resume Here After Restart)

### Booking System Phase 2: Host Management & Status Transitions
**Next Immediate Tasks**:
1. **Test Artist Dashboard**: Visit `/dashboard/bookings` with Landy Tyson account - should show booking to Elodi
2. **Build Host Dashboard**: Create `/dashboard/bookings` for hosts (Elodi's view of Landy's request)
3. **Booking Status Management**: Approve/reject/confirm workflow for hosts
4. **Real-time Updates**: Notification system for booking status changes

**Test Data Setup**:
- **Artist**: Landy Tyson (created clean profile, approved, paid)
- **Host**: Elodi (existing host to receive booking)
- **Booking Request**: Submitted from Landy to Elodi - should appear as PENDING

### Stripe Payment Integration ‚úÖ COMPLETED & OPERATIONAL

**Completed Features**:
- ‚úÖ Real Stripe account with test API keys configured
- ‚úÖ $400/year artist membership product created  
- ‚úÖ Database schema updated with Payment/Subscription models
- ‚úÖ Checkout session API endpoint functional
- ‚úÖ **Webhook handler active and processing payments**: `/api/payments/webhook/route.ts`
- ‚úÖ **Streamlined payment UI**: Direct Stripe Checkout integration (redundant forms removed)
- ‚úÖ **Automatic user activation**: Webhook processes payment and sets status to ACTIVE
- ‚úÖ **Localhost binding resolved**: Server runs with `next dev -H 0.0.0.0` flag
- ‚úÖ Webhook secret configured: `whsec_f4d40ed7b00b89cfed04fd36c591739e7e36f94a4018dab45b9f506932564852`

**Verified Working Flow**:
1. Artist visits `/payment/artist` ‚Üí Clicks "Start Your Music Journey - $400/year"
2. Redirects to Stripe Checkout ‚Üí Completes payment with test card `4242 4242 4242 4242`
3. Webhook processes events (customer.created, checkout.session.completed, etc.)
4. User status automatically updated to ACTIVE ‚Üí Full dashboard access granted

**Test Results**: Successfully tested with `judah@judah.com` - payment processed, user activated, dashboard accessible

### Complete Status-Based User Journey Implementation
**URGENT**: After payment testing, implement proper gating and routing for all user types

#### üìã Defined User Flow (FINAL SPEC):

**HOSTS:**
1. Submit Application ‚Üí `PENDING` ‚Üí **Holding Page** üìÑ
2. Admin Approval ‚Üí `ACTIVE` ‚Üí **Full Dashboard** ‚úÖ
3. Admin Rejection ‚Üí `REJECTED` ‚Üí **Rejection Notice** ‚ùå

**ARTISTS:**  
1. Submit Application ‚Üí `PENDING` ‚Üí **Holding Page** üìÑ
2. Admin Approval ‚Üí `APPROVED` ‚Üí **Payment Page** üí≥ ($400/year)
3. Payment Complete ‚Üí `ACTIVE` ‚Üí **Full Dashboard** ‚úÖ
4. Admin Rejection ‚Üí `REJECTED` ‚Üí **Rejection Notice** ‚ùå

**FANS:**
1. Registration ‚Üí `PENDING` ‚Üí **Fan Payment Page** üí≥ ($10/month)

- [ ] **Add rejection page component** for declined applications
- [ ] **Test routing logic** for all user types and statuses

##### 2. Admin Approval Logic Updates  
- [ ] **Modify artist approval** to set status to `APPROVED` (not `ACTIVE`)
- [ ] **Keep host approval** setting status to `ACTIVE` (direct access)
- [ ] **Update approval API** (`/api/admin/applications/[userId]/approve/route.ts`)

##### 3. Payment Integration
- [ ] **Fan payment flow** ($10/month subscription)
- [ ] **Artist payment completion** ‚Üí `ACTIVE` status handler
- [ ] **Payment verification** and status update webhooks
- [ ] **Separate pricing logic** (artists: $400/year, fans: $10/month)

##### 4. Data Mapping Confirmation
- [ ] **Application ‚Üí Dashboard data flow**: Approved applications become starting point for profiles
- [ ] **Photo migration**: Application photos populate dashboard galleries
- [ ] **Profile completion**: Users continue building profiles after activation

## üìä Current System State

1. **Holding page implementation** - users see progress, not broken experiences
2. **Payment integration** - fans and artists can complete activation
3. **Status-based routing** - no unauthorized dashboard access
4. **Admin approval flow** - proper APPROVED vs ACTIVE distinction

### Phase 2: Enhanced Experience  
1. **Email notifications** for status changes
2. **Dashboard starting data** from applications
3. **Profile completion flows**
