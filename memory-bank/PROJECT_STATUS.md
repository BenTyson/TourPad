## üöß CRITICAL NEXT PRIORITY (Immediate Sprint)

### Complete Status-Based User Journey Implementation
**URGENT**: Implement proper gating and routing for all user types

#### üìã Defined User Flow (FINAL SPEC):

**HOSTS:**
1. Submit Application ‚Üí `PENDING` ‚Üí **Holding Page** üìÑ
2. Admin Approval ‚Üí `ACTIVE` ‚Üí **Full Dashboard** ‚úÖ
3. Admin Rejection ‚Üí `REJECTED` ‚Üí **Rejection Notice** ‚ùå

**ARTISTS:**  
1. Submit Application ‚Üí `PENDING` ‚Üí **Holding Page** üìÑ
2. Admin Approval ‚Üí `APPROVED` ‚Üí **Payment Page** üí≥ ($400/year)
3. Payment Complete ‚Üí `ACTIVE` ‚Üí **Full Dashboard** ‚úÖ
4. Admin Rejection ‚Üí `REJECTED` ‚Üí **Rejection Notice** ‚ùå

**FANS:**
1. Registration ‚Üí `PENDING` ‚Üí **Fan Payment Page** üí≥ ($10/month)
2. Payment Complete ‚Üí `ACTIVE` ‚Üí **Fan Dashboard** ‚úÖ

#### üîß Implementation Tasks (HIGH PRIORITY):

##### 1. Dashboard Routing System
- [ ] **Create holding page component** (`/components/dashboard/HoldingPage.tsx`)
- [ ] **Update dashboard routing** (`/app/dashboard/page.tsx`) with status-based conditionals
- [ ] **Add rejection page component** for declined applications
- [ ] **Test routing logic** for all user types and statuses

##### 2. Admin Approval Logic Updates  
- [ ] **Modify artist approval** to set status to `APPROVED` (not `ACTIVE`)
- [ ] **Keep host approval** setting status to `ACTIVE` (direct access)
- [ ] **Update approval API** (`/api/admin/applications/[userId]/approve/route.ts`)

##### 3. Payment Integration
- [ ] **Fan payment flow** ($10/month subscription)
- [ ] **Artist payment completion** ‚Üí `ACTIVE` status handler
- [ ] **Payment verification** and status update webhooks
- [ ] **Separate pricing logic** (artists: $400/year, fans: $10/month)

##### 4. Data Mapping Confirmation
- [ ] **Application ‚Üí Dashboard data flow**: Approved applications become starting point for profiles
- [ ] **Photo migration**: Application photos populate dashboard galleries
- [ ] **Profile completion**: Users continue building profiles after activation

## üìä Current System State

### Database Status
- **Total Users**: 23 (9 artists, 9 hosts, 5 fans)
- **Pending Applications**: 6 (5 hosts including Dad Tyson + 1 artist Chad Michael)
- **Photo Storage**: Working - venue photos uploading to HostMedia table
- **Application Data**: Real submissions with all fields (additionalInfo, newToHosting)
- **File Serving**: `/api/files/[...path]/route.ts` serving images correctly

### Development Environment
- **Server**: Stable at localhost:3000 with memory optimization
- **TypeScript**: Clean compilation (major error fixes completed)
- **Admin Tools**: Fully operational with real-time data
- **Photo System**: Gallery components ready, proper categorization

## üéØ Sprint Goals (Next 1-2 Sessions)

### Phase 1: Core User Journey (CRITICAL)
1. **Holding page implementation** - users see progress, not broken experiences
2. **Payment integration** - fans and artists can complete activation
3. **Status-based routing** - no unauthorized dashboard access
4. **Admin approval flow** - proper APPROVED vs ACTIVE distinction

### Phase 2: Enhanced Experience  
1. **Email notifications** for status changes
2. **Dashboard starting data** from applications
3. **Profile completion flows**
