## Current Blockers ❌

### None - System Stable
**Major Crisis Resolved (July 19, 2025)**:
- Fixed 105+ TypeScript compilation errors that were destabilizing server
- Resolved unsafe array access patterns causing React crashes
- Implemented defensive programming with optional chaining throughout
- Server stability restored with nuclear reset procedures documented

## Next 3 Priorities

### 1. Booking Workflow Implementation
**Priority**: High
**Effort**: 2-3 days
**Description**: Implement artist booking requests to hosts
**Requirements**:
- Create `/api/bookings` endpoints (POST, GET, PATCH)
- Add booking request UI to artist dashboard
- Add booking response UI to host dashboard
- Implement email notifications for booking events

### 2. Concert Creation & Fan RSVP System
**Priority**: High
**Effort**: 3-4 days  
**Description**: Allow hosts to create public concerts, fans to RSVP
**Requirements**:
- Create `/api/concerts` endpoints
- Public concert discovery page
- Fan RSVP workflow with approval system
- Calendar integration for hosts

### 3. Payment System Integration
**Priority**: Medium
**Effort**: 4-5 days
**Description**: Stripe integration for artist memberships and booking fees
**Requirements**:
- Stripe Connect setup for multi-party payments
- Artist membership subscription flow
- Booking fee collection and distribution
- Payment status tracking and webhooks

## Recent Major Changes (Last 30 Days)

### July 19, 2025 - System Stability Crisis & Resolution
**Challenge**: Venue photo gallery implementation caused multiple localhost crashes
**Root Causes Found**:
1. 105+ TypeScript compilation errors across codebase
2. Unsafe array access patterns (`hostProfile.photos.length` without null checks)  
3. React re-render loops triggering Next.js hot reload issues

**Solutions Implemented**:
1. **Comprehensive TypeScript Fix**: Resolved all compilation errors systematically
2. **Defensive Programming**: Optional chaining (`?.`) implemented throughout
3. **Gallery System**: Successfully integrated venue photo galleries into host profiles
4. **UI Consolidation**: Removed redundant "Venue Photos" tab, kept Gallery tab
5. **Dashboard Cleanup**: Removed Sound System button, moved Lodging to profile tabs

**Outcome**: 
- ✅ Venue photo galleries fully working
- ✅ Server stability restored  
- ✅ Lodging system integrated into profile tabs
- ✅ Defensive programming patterns established
- ✅ TypeScript compilation clean (zero errors)

### Key Technical Achievements
- **Photo Management**: Multiple photo upload, display, delete for venues
- **Real-time Updates**: Photo changes without page refresh
- **Database Integration**: HostMedia model with sortOrder and categories
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive validation and user feedback
- **Code Quality**: Optional chaining and null safety throughout

## Technology Stack Status

### Working in Production-Ready State
- **Framework**: Next.js 15.3.5 (App Router)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js with Google OAuth
- **Frontend**: React 19 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS v4
- **File Storage**: Local (dev), AWS S3 ready (prod)
- **Validation**: React Hook Form + Zod schemas

### Ready for Integration
- **Payments**: Stripe Connect infrastructure
- **Email**: SendGrid configuration ready
- **Real-time**: WebSocket/Pusher ready for messaging
- **Monitoring**: Error handling patterns established
- **Deployment**: Vercel configuration ready

## Data Architecture Status

### Dual Data Source Strategy (Transitional)
**Current Pattern**:
- **mockData.ts**: UI display data for listings and cards (IDs: '1', '2', '3')
- **realTestData.ts**: Authentication system (IDs: 'artist1', 'host1', 'fan1') 
- **Database**: Live data for profiles, images, core functionality

**ID Mapping Working**:
```typescript
// Session uses realTestData IDs ('artist1')
// UI components use mockData IDs ('1')
// Dashboard maps between them successfully
```

### Migration Strategy
- **Phase 1 Complete**: Profile system fully database-integrated
- **Phase 2 Ready**: Booking system database models complete
- **Phase 3 Planned**: Full migration from mock data to database

## Development Environment Status

### Localhost Stability ✅
- **Server**: Running stable on localhost:3000
- **Database**: PostgreSQL connection working
- **Hot Reload**: Functioning without crashes
- **TypeScript**: Zero compilation errors
- **File Uploads**: Working end-to-end

### Nuclear Reset Procedure (When Needed)
```bash
killall node 2>/dev/null
rm -rf .next node_modules  
npm install
npx prisma generate
npm run dev
```

## File Organization

### Critical Working Files
```
/src/app/dashboard/profile/page.tsx    # Profile editing with all tabs (2,500+ lines)
/src/app/api/profile/route.ts          # Profile data with photos array
/src/app/api/upload/route.ts           # File upload endpoint
/src/app/api/hosts/[id]/route.ts       # Public host profiles
/prisma/schema.prisma                  # 16 database models
/src/data/mockData.ts                  # UI display data (transitioning)
/src/data/realTestData.ts              # Auth system data (transitioning)
```

### Recent File Changes
