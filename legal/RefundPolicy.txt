# Cancellation & Refund Policy

*Last updated: [DATE]*

## Overview

This policy covers cancellations and refunds for TourPad subscriptions and services. Since house concerts involve real people making plans, we encourage clear communication and early notice when changes are needed.

## Subscription Cancellations & Refunds

### Artist and Fan Subscriptions

#### Monthly Subscriptions
- **Cancellation**: Cancel anytime from your account settings
- **Effective Date**: Cancellation takes effect at the end of your current billing period
- **Refunds**: No refunds for partial months, but you keep access until the period ends
- **Reactivation**: You can reactivate anytime before your access expires

#### Annual Subscriptions
- **Within 30 Days**: Full refund if you cancel within 30 days of purchase
- **After 30 Days**: No refund, but service continues until the end of your annual period
- **Exceptional Circumstances**: We may offer prorated refunds for documented emergencies or platform issues

### Processing Time
- Refunds are processed within 5-7 business days
- Refunds appear on your original payment method
- Contact support@tourpad.com if you don't see your refund after 10 business days

## Concert Cancellations

*Note: TourPad facilitates connections but doesn't directly handle concert bookings. However, we encourage these practices for a healthy community.*

### Recommended Practices

#### For Artists
**Advance Notice**
- 7+ days notice: Generally acceptable for most situations
- 24-48 hours notice: Only for emergencies or serious circumstances
- Same-day cancellation: Should be limited to true emergencies

**Communication**
- Contact the host directly through TourPad messaging
- Explain the situation clearly and apologetically
- Offer to reschedule if possible

#### For Hosts
**Flexibility**
- Understand that touring involves uncertainties
- Consider rescheduling when possible
- Communicate any limitations or conflicts early

**Notice to Fans**
- Inform RSVPed fans as soon as possible
- Use TourPad's messaging system to reach attendees
- Provide clear information about cancellation or rescheduling

## Platform-Related Refunds

### When We Provide Refunds
- **Platform Outages**: Extended downtime that prevents service use
- **Billing Errors**: Incorrect charges or technical payment issues
- **Account Problems**: Issues caused by platform bugs or errors

### When We Don't Provide Refunds
- **Change of Mind**: Deciding you don't want to use the service
- **Concert Cancellations**: Issues between users (artists, hosts, fans)
- **Unused Services**: Not using your subscription during the billing period
- **Violation Suspensions**: Account restrictions due to guideline violations

## Special Circumstances

### Emergencies and Hardships
We understand that life happens. For documented emergencies, serious illness, or genuine hardship situations, contact our support team. We'll review each case individually and may offer:
- Subscription pauses
- Partial refunds
- Extended access periods
- Payment plan adjustments

### Platform Changes
If we make significant changes to TourPad that substantially affect your ability to use the service, we may offer refunds for unused portions of annual subscriptions.

## Dispute Resolution

### Step 1: Contact Support
Before disputing charges with your bank or credit card company, please contact us at support@tourpad.com. Many issues can be resolved quickly through direct communication.

### Step 2: Review Period
We'll investigate your request within 5 business days and respond with our decision and reasoning.

### Step 3: Appeals
If you disagree with our decision, you can appeal by providing additional information or documentation.

## Concert-Related Disputes

### TourPad's Role
- We provide the platform for connections
- We don't mediate individual concert arrangements
- Users are encouraged to resolve booking issues directly

### Best Practices for Resolution
- Communicate openly and honestly
- Consider the other party's perspective
- Look for compromise solutions (rescheduling, partial arrangements)
- Leave honest reviews about your experience

### When TourPad May Step In
- Platform technical issues affecting bookings
- Violations of our Community Guidelines
- Safety concerns related to platform use

## Payment Processing

### Stripe Integration
- All payments are processed through Stripe
- Stripe's terms and policies also apply to your transactions
- Some refund timing depends on Stripe's processing schedule

### Failed Payments
- Failed subscription payments result in account restrictions
- You have 7 days to update payment information before suspension
- No additional fees for payment failures

## Account Deletion

### Your Data
- Account deletion removes your personal information
- You lose access to messages, booking history, and reviews
- Deletion is permanent and cannot be undone

### Financial Implications
- No refunds for remaining subscription time after account deletion
- Outstanding payments must be resolved before deletion
- You can download your data before deleting your account

We may update this policy as TourPad evolves. Significant changes will be communicated via:
- Email notification to active subscribers
