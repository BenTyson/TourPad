Welcome to Listening Room Network

We encourage you to read this boring legal document all the way through, but we know you probably won't. So here's the ultra-short version:
1. It's not our fault.
2. You are 18 or older.

Here's a short, more entertaining version:
1. In essence, you agree that your concerts are your responsibility, and that if David Wilcox's guitar catches on fire from one of your candles... you won't try to make it our fault.

2. Hosting concerts with professional artists is an adult responsibility, so you must be 18 or older to accept these terms.

If any of this makes you uncomfortable, we understand, and you have no obligation to continue. If you're as brave as we are, then continue!

PS - Here's the actual legal document:

Legal Information and Disclaimer

ListeningRoomNetwork cannot be held liable for any damages whatsoever arising from the use of the site or the use of contents available on the sites for which hyperlinks are included.

ListeningRoomNetwork cannot be held responsible in any way for the contents and presentation of material accessed directly or indirectly through the site. In particular, ListeningRoomNetwork cannot be required to ensure compliance with the diversity of local laws, regulations and customs occurring worldwide. Any concert venue can be held to local scrutiny... and it is up to the event presenters to comply with local and state laws.

ListeningRoomNetwork encourages members to carry professional indemnity insurance, and advises potential clients to check with individual members the nature and extent of their coverage. Publicly promoted shows most often require licences from PRO agencies, like ASCAP, BMI, SESAC in the U.S. Each country has their own version of this... PRS, SOCAN, etc. Licenses are the responsibility of the venue. It is possible to keep your shows private and avoid these licences.

ListeningRoomNetwork itself accepts no liability for any actual, incidental, indirect, special or consequential damages, including lost profits arising from the use of ListeningRoomNetwork members' services.

ListeningRoomNetwork takes great care in screening its members. However, it is not possible to exclude hypertext links to sites which may not be subject to our scrutiny, neither is it possible to monitor all activities of our members. ListeningRoomNetwork cannot make any warranties or guarantees about them.
