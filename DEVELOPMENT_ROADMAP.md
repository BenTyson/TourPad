# TourPad Development Roadmap

## Project Overview
TourPad is a Next.js-based platform connecting touring musicians with hosts for intimate house concerts and small shows, while also serving music fans who want to discover and attend these exclusive events. The platform uses a **gated access model** where artists and hosts must apply and be approved before accessing the community, while fans can register and pay directly for immediate access. The public site serves as a teaser to generate interest without revealing actual user information. Currently in active development with a solid frontend foundation using mock data, preparing for backend integration.

### User Types

## Known Technical Debt

### Critical Issues to Address
1. **No Error Handling**: Zero try-catch blocks throughout application
2. **Mock Data Dependency**: All features currently use static mock data
3. **Missing Validation**: Only basic HTML validation, no client-side logic
4. **Debug Code**: Extensive console.log statements need removal
5. **Incomplete Media Upload**: File upload simulation only, no real backend
6. **Security Gaps**: No input sanitization, CSRF protection, or rate limiting
7. **Open Access Current State**: All artist/host data currently visible - needs gated access implementation

### Backend Integration Points
These files contain TODO comments that need backend implementation:
- `/src/app/bookings/new/page.tsx:62` - Submit booking request
- `/src/app/bookings/[id]/page.tsx:55,66` - Booking approval/rejection

## Development Guidelines

### Code Quality Standards
- Always use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow existing component patterns and naming conventions
- Maintain responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Use existing UI components from the design system
- Write comprehensive form validation with Zod schemas

### Testing Strategy
- Test components with mock data during frontend development
- Create integration tests for API endpoints when backend is implemented
- Add end-to-end tests for critical user flows (booking, registration)
- Test file upload functionality with various file types and sizes

### Documentation
- Update this roadmap as features are completed
- Document API endpoints as they are implemented
- Maintain component documentation for the UI library
- Create deployment and setup guides for production

## Notes & Decisions

### Architecture Decisions
- **Next.js App Router**: Using modern App Router for better performance and developer experience
- **Tailwind CSS v4**: Latest version for improved styling capabilities
- **Mock Data Strategy**: Building complete frontend first, then replacing with real data
- **Component Library**: Custom UI components for consistency across the application
- **Gated Access Model**: Strategic decision to keep artist/host data private until approval + payment verification
- **Public Teaser Strategy**: Public pages designed to generate interest without revealing sensitive community information
- **Three-Stage User Journey**: Application ‚Üí Approval + Payment ‚Üí Full Profile (reduces application abandonment)
- **Payment-After-Approval**: $400/year artist fee only charged after human approval
- **Communication Containment**: Airbnb-style messaging to retain users on platform
- **Dashboard Notifications**: In-app notification center rather than push notifications
- **Mapbox Integration**: Better privacy controls and customization for address hiding
- **Hybrid Video Strategy**: YouTube/Vimeo URLs for applications, direct uploads for profiles
- **48-Hour Response Standard**: Industry-appropriate timeframe with automated reminders
- **Warm Earth Tone Palette**: Moving from blue/purple to rose/beige/sage for more intimate, organic feel

### Future Considerations
- **Mobile App**: Consider React Native or PWA for mobile experience
- **Internationalization**: Plan for multi-language support
- **Advanced Search**: Elasticsearch for complex venue and artist search
- **Video Streaming**: Consider video streaming service for performance videos
- **Social Features**: User reviews, ratings, and social sharing

## üöÄ Implementation Strategy Summary

### **Phase Priority Order:**
1. **Design System Overhaul** - New warm earth tone palette and component redesign
2. **Application/Approval System** - Critical for gated access model with new visual identity
3. **Host Media Management** - Complete feature parity with artists
4. **Backend Integration** - Replace mock data with real functionality
5. **Premium Features** - Tour planning tools and advanced matching

### **Key Technical Decisions Made:**
- **User Flows**: 
  - **Artists/Hosts**: Application (minimal) ‚Üí Approval ‚Üí Payment (artists only) ‚Üí Full Profile
  - **Fans**: Registration ‚Üí Payment ‚Üí Immediate Access
- **Admin Review**: Human approval with follow-up questions capability (artists/hosts only)
- **Payment Model**: 
  - $400/year for artists (after approval)
  - Free for hosts (after approval)
  - TBD pricing for fans (likely $20-50/year for immediate concert access)
- **Communication**: Platform-contained messaging with Airbnb-style retention
- **Response Times**: 48-hour standard with automated reminders
- **Tour Planning**: Premium add-on with placeholder pricing during development
- **Notifications**: Dashboard-based notification center, not push notifications
- **Fan Integration**: Direct payment access, view-only artist/host directories, full concert discovery features

### **Streamlined Application Data Models:**

**Artist Application (Stage 1) - Minimal & Focused:**
```typescript
interface ArtistApplication {
  bio: string; // Character limit (300-500 chars)
  performanceVideoUrl: string; // YouTube/Vimeo live performance
  musicProfileUrl: string; // Spotify or Apple Music artist profile
  socialLinks: {
    facebook?: string;
    instagram?: string;
  };
  pressPhoto: File; // Single high-quality press photo upload
  genre: string; // Primary genre selection
}
```

**Host Application (Stage 1) - Streamlined Essentials:**
```typescript
interface HostApplication {
  location: string; // City, State format
  estimatedAttendance: number; // Average attendance at their concerts
  concertSpacePhotos: File[]; // Photo(s) of concert space
  hostingMotivation: string; // "What do you enjoy most about hosting house concerts?"
  additionalInfo?: string; // "Is there anything else you would like to let us know?" (optional)
}
```

**Fan Registration (Direct Payment) - Simple & Fast:**
```typescript
interface FanRegistration {
  name: string; // Full name
  email: string; // Email address
  location: string; // City, State format for nearby concert discovery
  favoriteGenres: string[]; // Musical preferences for recommendations (optional)
  referralSource?: string; // How they heard about TourPad (optional)
  // Note: No approval needed - goes straight to payment after registration
}
```

### **Next Critical Implementations:**
1. **Backend Foundation** - Database design and API setup for real data integration
2. **Payment Integration** - Stripe setup for artist membership ($400/year) and subscription management
3. **Authentication System** - NextAuth integration with user session management
4. **Public Landing Pages** - Design compelling artist/host value propositions with earth tone branding
5. **Enhanced Search Reimplementation** - Carefully rebuild advanced filtering without server issues
