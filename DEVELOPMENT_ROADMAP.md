## Known Technical Debt

### Critical Issues to Address
1. **No Error Handling**: Zero try-catch blocks throughout application
2. **Mock Data Dependency**: All features currently use static mock data
3. **Missing Validation**: Only basic HTML validation, no client-side logic
4. **Debug Code**: Extensive console.log statements need removal
5. **Incomplete Media Upload**: File upload simulation only, no real backend
6. **Security Gaps**: No input sanitization, CSRF protection, or rate limiting

### Backend Integration Points
These files contain TODO comments that need backend implementation:
- `/src/app/bookings/new/page.tsx:62` - Submit booking request
- `/src/app/bookings/[id]/page.tsx:55,66` - Booking approval/rejection
- `/src/app/register/page.tsx:24` - User registration
- `/src/app/onboarding/artist/page.tsx:67` - Artist onboarding submission
- `/src/app/onboarding/host/page.tsx:62` - Host onboarding submission
- `/src/app/subscription/page.tsx:43,48` - Stripe subscription management

## Development Guidelines

### Code Quality Standards
- Always use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow existing component patterns and naming conventions
- Maintain responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Use existing UI components from the design system
- Write comprehensive form validation with Zod schemas

### Testing Strategy
- Test components with mock data during frontend development
- Create integration tests for API endpoints when backend is implemented
- Add end-to-end tests for critical user flows (booking, registration)
- Test file upload functionality with various file types and sizes

### Documentation
- Update this roadmap as features are completed
- Document API endpoints as they are implemented
- Maintain component documentation for the UI library
- Create deployment and setup guides for production

## Notes & Decisions

### Architecture Decisions
- **Next.js App Router**: Using modern App Router for better performance and developer experience
- **Tailwind CSS v4**: Latest version for improved styling capabilities
- **Mock Data Strategy**: Building complete frontend first, then replacing with real data
- **Component Library**: Custom UI components for consistency across the application

### Future Considerations
- **Mobile App**: Consider React Native or PWA for mobile experience
- **Internationalization**: Plan for multi-language support
- **Advanced Search**: Elasticsearch for complex venue and artist search
- **Video Streaming**: Consider video streaming service for performance videos
- **Social Features**: User reviews, ratings, and social sharing
