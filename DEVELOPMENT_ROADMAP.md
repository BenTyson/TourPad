# TourPad Development Roadmap

## Project Overview
TourPad is a Next.js-based platform connecting touring musicians with hosts for intimate house concerts and small shows. The platform uses a **gated access model** where artists and hosts must apply and be approved before accessing the community, with artists requiring additional payment verification. The public site serves as a teaser to generate interest without revealing actual user information. Currently in active development with a solid frontend foundation using mock data, preparing for backend integration.

## Current Status
- ‚úÖ **Frontend Foundation Complete**: Comprehensive UI components, routing, and layouts
- ‚úÖ **Artist Media Management**: Full upload, categorization, and management system
- ‚úÖ **Booking Workflow UI**: Complete booking request and approval interface
- ‚úÖ **Dashboard System**: Role-based dashboards for artists and hosts
- ‚úÖ **Mock Data Infrastructure**: Rich data models for testing and development
- üîÑ **Host Media Management**: In progress - missing upload/management functionality
- ‚ùå **Backend Integration**: All features currently use mock data

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15.3.5, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4
- **Forms**: React Hook Form + Zod validation
- **UI**: Headless UI, Heroicons, custom component library
- **Backend**: TBD (needs implementation)
- **Database**: TBD (needs implementation)
- **File Storage**: TBD (needs implementation)

## Known Technical Debt

### Critical Issues to Address
1. **No Error Handling**: Zero try-catch blocks throughout application
2. **Mock Data Dependency**: All features currently use static mock data
3. **Missing Validation**: Only basic HTML validation, no client-side logic
4. **Debug Code**: Extensive console.log statements need removal
5. **Incomplete Media Upload**: File upload simulation only, no real backend
6. **Security Gaps**: No input sanitization, CSRF protection, or rate limiting
7. **Open Access Current State**: All artist/host data currently visible - needs gated access implementation

### Backend Integration Points
These files contain TODO comments that need backend implementation:
- `/src/app/bookings/new/page.tsx:62` - Submit booking request
- `/src/app/bookings/[id]/page.tsx:55,66` - Booking approval/rejection
- `/src/app/register/page.tsx:24` - User registration
- `/src/app/onboarding/artist/page.tsx:67` - Artist onboarding submission
- `/src/app/onboarding/host/page.tsx:62` - Host onboarding submission
- `/src/app/subscription/page.tsx:43,48` - Stripe subscription management

## Development Guidelines

### Code Quality Standards
- Always use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow existing component patterns and naming conventions
- Maintain responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Use existing UI components from the design system
- Write comprehensive form validation with Zod schemas

### Testing Strategy
- Test components with mock data during frontend development
- Create integration tests for API endpoints when backend is implemented
- Add end-to-end tests for critical user flows (booking, registration)
- Test file upload functionality with various file types and sizes

### Documentation
- Update this roadmap as features are completed
- Document API endpoints as they are implemented
- Maintain component documentation for the UI library
- Create deployment and setup guides for production

## Notes & Decisions

### Architecture Decisions
- **Next.js App Router**: Using modern App Router for better performance and developer experience
- **Tailwind CSS v4**: Latest version for improved styling capabilities
- **Mock Data Strategy**: Building complete frontend first, then replacing with real data
- **Component Library**: Custom UI components for consistency across the application
- **Gated Access Model**: Strategic decision to keep artist/host data private until approval + payment verification
- **Public Teaser Strategy**: Public pages designed to generate interest without revealing sensitive community information
- **Three-Stage User Journey**: Application ‚Üí Approval + Payment ‚Üí Full Profile (reduces application abandonment)
- **Payment-After-Approval**: $400/year artist fee only charged after human approval
- **Communication Containment**: Airbnb-style messaging to retain users on platform
- **Dashboard Notifications**: In-app notification center rather than push notifications
- **Mapbox Integration**: Better privacy controls and customization for address hiding
- **Hybrid Video Strategy**: YouTube/Vimeo URLs for applications, direct uploads for profiles
- **48-Hour Response Standard**: Industry-appropriate timeframe with automated reminders

### Future Considerations
- **Mobile App**: Consider React Native or PWA for mobile experience
- **Internationalization**: Plan for multi-language support
- **Advanced Search**: Elasticsearch for complex venue and artist search
- **Video Streaming**: Consider video streaming service for performance videos
- **Social Features**: User reviews, ratings, and social sharing

## üöÄ Implementation Strategy Summary

### **Phase Priority Order:**
1. **Application/Approval System** - Critical for gated access model
2. **Host Media Management** - Complete feature parity with artists
3. **Backend Integration** - Replace mock data with real functionality
4. **Premium Features** - Tour planning tools and advanced matching

### **Key Technical Decisions Made:**
- **User Flow**: Application (minimal) ‚Üí Approval ‚Üí Payment ‚Üí Full Profile (detailed)
- **Admin Review**: Human approval with follow-up questions capability
- **Payment Model**: $400/year for artists, free for hosts (for now)
- **Communication**: Platform-contained messaging with Airbnb-style retention
- **Response Times**: 48-hour standard with automated reminders
- **Tour Planning**: Premium add-on with placeholder pricing during development
- **Notifications**: Dashboard-based notification center, not push notifications

### **Streamlined Application Data Models:**

**Artist Application (Stage 1) - Minimal & Focused:**
```typescript
interface ArtistApplication {
  bio: string; // Character limit (300-500 chars)
  performanceVideoUrl: string; // YouTube/Vimeo live performance
  musicProfileUrl: string; // Spotify or Apple Music artist profile
  socialLinks: {
    facebook?: string;
    instagram?: string;
  };
  pressPhoto: File; // Single high-quality press photo upload
  genre: string; // Primary genre selection
}
```

**Host Application (Stage 1) - Streamlined Essentials:**
```typescript
interface HostApplication {
  location: string; // City, State format
  estimatedAttendance: number; // Average attendance at their concerts
  concertSpacePhotos: File[]; // Photo(s) of concert space
  hostingMotivation: string; // "What do you enjoy most about hosting house concerts?"
  additionalInfo?: string; // "Is there anything else you would like to let us know?" (optional)
}
```

### **Next Critical Implementations:**
1. Split current artist onboarding into streamlined application vs. profile
2. Build admin dashboard for application review
3. Complete host media management system  
4. Design public landing pages with separate artist/host value propositions
5. Implement enhanced search and filtering systems
