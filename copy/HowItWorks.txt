# How It Works

## Connecting Music Lovers Through House Concerts

Imagine walking into someone's living room and hearing your new favorite band perform just for you and twenty other music lovers. Picture an artist sleeping on a host's couch after an incredible show, sharing stories over breakfast before hitting the road to the next city. Think about discovering music in backyards, lofts, and unique spaces where every note feels personal.

This is the world TourPad creates—where artists, hosts, and fans come together to build an ecosystem of authentic musical connection that simply doesn't exist in traditional venues.

## For Artists: Tour Smarter, Connect Deeper

As a touring musician, you know the challenges: finding venues that actually care about your music, dealing with promoters who take massive cuts, and performing for crowds that might not even be listening. TourPad changes everything about how you tour.

When you join TourPad, you create a profile that truly represents who you are as an artist. Share your music, showcase your band with photos and videos, and tell hosts about your upcoming tour plans. You can indicate when you'll be available in different states and cities, making it easy for hosts across the country to discover you're planning to be in their area.

Our interactive map becomes your touring command center. You can explore host venues nationwide, each with detailed information about their space, capacity, and what makes their venue special. Want to find hosts who love indie folk in Colorado? Looking for a place with overnight accommodations in Portland? Our filtering system helps you discover exactly what you need. You'll see general locations for privacy and safety, but once you book a show, you get complete contact information and exact addresses.

The booking process itself is refreshingly simple. Hosts can reach out to you directly, or you can message venues that catch your eye. When someone sends you a booking request, you'll collaborate through our platform to nail down all the details—dates, times, technical needs, sleeping arrangements, and anything else that matters for your show. When everything looks perfect to both of you, the concert gets confirmed and published for fans to discover.

Here's where TourPad really shines: you keep 100% of everything. Every dollar from the door goes into your pocket. Every piece of merchandise sold is yours. No venue cuts, no promoter fees, no hidden charges. You're building direct relationships with people who genuinely want to support your music, and many of these connections turn into lasting friendships and repeat bookings as you tour through their city again.

## For Hosts: Share Your Space, Support Live Music

Maybe you've always dreamed of having concerts in your backyard. Perhaps you remember house shows from college and want to bring that magic back into your life. Or you simply love music and want to support touring artists in a meaningful way. Whatever brought you here, hosting house concerts through TourPad transforms your space into something special.

Your host profile tells the story of your venue and who you are as a music lover. Upload photos of your listening space—whether it's a cozy living room, a spacious backyard, an industrial loft, or something completely unique. Share details about your capacity, what genres excite you most, and your experience hosting or attending house concerts. If you have overnight accommodations for touring musicians, showcase those too with photos and details about beds, bathrooms, and amenities.

Finding artists to host becomes an adventure in music discovery. Browse profiles of touring musicians, listen to their music, and see when they're planning to be in your area. When you find someone whose music speaks to you, send them a message or submit a booking request. Our platform makes it easy to collaborate on all the details that make a house concert successful.

Once you confirm a show with an artist, it gets published on TourPad's calendar and map where local fans can discover it. You control your guest list by approving RSVPs up to your venue's capacity, and you can share the exact address with confirmed attendees when you're ready. The beautiful thing about house concerts is watching strangers become friends over shared musical experiences in your space.

Best of all, you get to use TourPad completely free. We believe hosts are the backbone of the house concert community, and we want to support the people who make these magical evenings possible.

## For Fans: Discover Intimate Musical Experiences

Concert venues keep getting bigger, tickets keep getting more expensive, and the experience feels increasingly disconnected from the music itself. TourPad brings you back to what live music should be: intimate, personal, and real.

When you create your fan profile, you're joining a community of people who value authentic musical experiences. Share your musical tastes and location, then start exploring the concerts happening in your area. You can browse artist profiles, listen to their music, and discover new sounds before deciding which shows to attend.

The magic happens when you RSVP to a concert. Instead of buying a ticket from a faceless corporation, you're connecting directly with someone who loves music enough to open their home for it. Once the host approves your RSVP, you'll receive the exact address and any special instructions for the evening.

These aren't typical concerts. You might find yourself sitting on a couch while a singer-songwriter performs three feet away. You could be dancing in someone's backyard while a band plays under string lights. After the show, you'll likely chat with the artists about their music, their tour, and their stories. You're not just attending a concert—you're becoming part of the artist's journey and the host's community.

Following your favorite artists and hosts keeps you connected to future shows, and sharing photos and experiences from concerts you attend helps other fans discover new music and venues. Every review you leave and every connection you make strengthens the entire TourPad community.

## The Interactive Map: Your Music Discovery Tool

At the heart of TourPad lies an interactive map that serves as everyone's window into the house concert world, but it shows different information depending on who you are.

Artists see the landscape of possibilities across the country. Host venues appear as points on the map showing general areas rather than exact addresses, protecting privacy while giving you a sense of where opportunities exist. You can filter by musical genres, venue capacity, available dates, lodging options, and amenities to find exactly what your tour needs. The map also shows confirmed concerts, giving you insight into what's happening in the house concert community.

Hosts use the map to see artist tour routes and availability, helping them understand when musicians might be coming through their area. They can also view confirmed concerts nearby, which often inspire ideas for their own shows and help them connect with other hosts in their region.

Fans see confirmed concerts they can actually attend, turning the map into a discovery tool for finding new music and unique venues in their area. The filtering system helps them focus on genres they love while staying open to musical surprises.

## The Magic of House Concerts

What makes house concerts special isn't just the intimate setting—it's the complete reimagining of how music, artists, and audiences connect.

For artists, TourPad represents freedom from the traditional music industry's limitations. You're not splitting your earnings with venue owners who see you as just another booking. You're not performing for distracted crowds in sterile spaces. Instead, you're building genuine relationships with hosts who believe in your music and fans who are genuinely excited to discover new sounds. Many artists find that house concert hosts become lifelong friends and supporters, offering places to stay year after year as they tour through different cities.

Hosts discover the profound joy of bringing live music into their communities. There's something magical about watching your living room transform into a concert venue, seeing neighbors meet each other for the first time, and knowing you've created a space where art can flourish. Many hosts become deeply connected to the artists they support, following their careers and feeling genuinely invested in their success.

Fans get access to musical experiences that simply don't exist anywhere else. You're not watching a distant figure on a stage—you're sharing space with artists in an environment where every note matters. You meet other music lovers who might become lifelong friends. You discover new artists before they hit bigger venues, and you directly support musicians in a way that actually makes a difference in their lives.

## Building the Future of Live Music

TourPad isn't trying to replace traditional venues—we're creating something entirely different. We're building a community where music lovers support each other, where artists can tour sustainably while keeping their earnings, and where fans can experience music the way it was meant to be heard: intimately, personally, and authentically.

Every house concert strengthens this ecosystem. Artists build fanbases of people who genuinely care about their music. Hosts create musical communities in their neighborhoods. Fans discover new sounds and form connections that extend far beyond any single show.

Whether you're an artist dreaming of touring without compromise, a host wanting to bring live music into your community, or a fan seeking authentic musical experiences, TourPad connects you with people who share your passion for live music done right.

The future of live music isn't bigger venues and higher ticket prices—it's more personal, more connected, and more real. It's happening in living rooms and backyards across the country, and it's waiting for you to be part of it.
